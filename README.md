 Problem Description
 (NOTE: The following describes a hypothetical scenario. While ecological pressures
 on pollinators are real, the crisis outlined below has not occurred... yet.)
 
 As an intern at a national laboratory, you are tasked with responding to a
 global crisis. Over the past year, there has been a precipitous decline in pollinator
 populations worldwide. Immediate action is required to reverse the trend; however,
 a thorough understanding of the problem is necessary before proposing a solution.
 
 Your responsibility is to select and analyze relevant data, interpret your find
ings, and recommend a strategy. Multiple teams are working on different aspects
 of this issue, and your group has been assigned to focus on monarch butterflies.
 
 Your report must address the following:
 ˆ A detailed description of monarch butterfly population fluctuations.
 ˆ An investigation of factors that may be contributing to these population
 changes, and the potential consequences for human well-being.
 ˆ A recommendation for resource allocation, prioritizing the most significant
 factors identified in your analysis.
 ˆ A focused analysis of the monarch butterfly migration through Texas, with
 comparisons to other states.
 Your team will deliver an executive report supported by an appendix containing
 technical details.
 
 Tasks for the Intermediate Level Competition of the 2024 Rowdy Datathon: 

 1. Visit Journey North and create a map displaying the number of monarch
 butterfly sightings by county. Since the dataset only includes city and state
 information, use an LLM API to programmatically infer the county from
 the city. Follow the instructions in Section 2.2 of “2024 Rowdy Datathon
 Supplementary Material” to color each county according to the number of
 monarch sightings.

 3. Utilize the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System
 Pre-generated Files or the EPA AQS API to gather air quality and temper
ature data for the dates relevant to your study of Journey North data.

 5. Perform a statistical analysis to investigate whether there is a significant
 correlation between temperature, air quality, and monarch butterfly decline
